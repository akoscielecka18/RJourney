### Dplyr 
The dplyr package is used for simple and fast data processing. Advantages: <br>
speed of operation, <br>
folding allows functions to be chained together which prevents code cluttering,<br>
simplicity and efficiency of syntax
```` r
library(dplyr)
````
To use this package you need to install it first library.  <br>
For the following examples, we will use the built-in ```` mtcars ```` 
and ```` iris ```` data sets, as well as ```` countries ```` from the ```` Przewodnik ```` package.
To see what is in this data we use ```` head ````.
````r
head(mtcars)
````
### Operators -> / = and %>% - pipe
The ```` %>% ```` operator is used to combine multiple functions into one seamless operation, 
making the code more readable and easier to understand. The ```` %>% ```` operator passes
the result of one function as the first argument to the next function. 
This avoids nesting functions and improves code readability.
#### Example 
```` r
mtcars %>%
  filter(hp>100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mpg)) %>%
  head()
````

### Function group_by()
The ```` group_by ```` function is usually not used by itself, it does not change 
the data by itself. It adds a certain tag based on the selected factor (or factors) 
and subsequent operations will be performed on the resulting groups.
```` r
countries %>%
  group_by(continent)%>%  
  summarize(mean(birth.rate, na.rm=TRUE))
````

#### 1
- For the embedded iris data frame: <br>
count the maximum of the Sepal.Length variable for each species separately <br>
add a column with the above data to the original data frame
```` r
library(dplyr)
library(Przewodnik)
data(iris)
data(countries)
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  mutate(Max.Sepal.Length = max(Sepal.Length))%>%
  ungroup() %>%
  head()
````

### Function select()

The ````select()```` function is used to select or discard selected columns from the data frame.
By column names you specify those columns you want to select, 
and by column names preceded by a minus - those you want to discard:
```` r
countries%>%
  select(country, population, continent)%>%
  head()
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/886f1935-d0f9-4499-93e7-0aca76b00659)

### Function filter()
The ````filter()```` function is used to select data (rows) that meet the selected criteria. 
For numeric data we have standard operators <, =<, >, >=, ==, !=. 
For text data, you can use %in% variable c(possibility1, possibility2, ...) 
when the variable is to belong to a given set of “possibilities” or 
!variable %in% c(possibility1, possibility2, ...) for a set of exclusions. Conditions 
can be flexibly combined using logical | - “or”, alternative, & - “and”, conjunction.

````r
countries%>%
  filter(continent %in% c("Asia", "Europe") & (birth.rate>32 | birth.rate<9))
````
### Function distinct()
The ````distinct()```` function simply allows you to get rid of duplicate data.

````r
ramka=data.frame(płeć=sample(c('K', 'M'),20, replace = TRUE),
  ocena=sample(c(2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0), 20, replace = TRUE))
dim(ramka)
--------
ramka%>%
  distinct()%>%
  dim()
````
### Function arrange()
The ````arrange()```` function is used to sort against a selected factor, 
and more than one factor considered in case of a tie can be specified.
For descending order, the given factor should be placed in desc().

````r
ramka=data.frame(płeć=sample(c('K', 'M'),100, replace = TRUE),
ocena=sample(c(2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0), 100, replace = TRUE),
wzrost=rnorm(100,170,25))
----------------------------
ramka%>%
  arrange(płeć, desc(wzrost))
````
#### 2
- From the iris collection using the command string: <br>
remove the columns Petal.Length and Petal.Width <br>
select only setosa and virginica species <br>
select only those observations where Sepal.Length is between values of 5.1 and 6.4 <br>
select only those observations where Sepal.Width is less than 3.0 or greater than 3.3 <br>
sort the data in descending order due to Sepal.Width.

````r
iris %>%
  select(-Petal.Length, -Petal.Width) %>%          
  filter(Species %in% c("setosa", "virginica")) %>% 
  filter(Sepal.Length > 5.1 & Sepal.Length < 6.4) %>% 
  filter(Sepal.Width < 3.0 | Sepal.Width > 3.3) %>%  
  arrange(desc(Sepal.Width)) %>%  
head()
````

### Function summarize()
The ````summarize()```` or alternatively ````summarise()```` function allows 
you to provide some metrics, statistics for the dataset under study. 
It is often used together with group_by() to allow summarization for each subgroup.
Using this function requires specifying the names of the new columns to be created
and passing to the summarize() function the data and functions (e.g. min, sd, max) to be used.

````r
countries%>%
  summarize(
    pop_avar=mean(population),
    pop_max=max(population),
    pop_min=min(population)
  )
--------------------------------
countries%>%
  group_by(continent)%>%
  summarize(
    pop_avar=mean(population), 
    pop_max=max(population),
    pop_min=min(population)
  )
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc9ab55f-9e0f-4e89-90d6-d3e0fde4acd4)

### Function across()
If we want to apply a series of functions (min, max, mean, standard deviation, etc.) to more than one variable, we can use the summarize() function multiple times. 
It is more efficient to use the ````across()```` function inside summarize(). Its arguments are a list of functions and a set of variables to which these functions are to be applied:

````r
countries%>%
  group_by(continent)%>%
  summarize(
    across(
      c(birth.rate, death.rate, population), 
      list(min, max, mean)
    )
  )
````
### Function count()
The ````count()```` function is used to count the number of observations in a group.
````r
iris%>%
  group_by(Species)%>%
  count()
````
## Functions related to data transformation
This is a group of functions for changing existing columns, adding new ones and renaming them.
### Function mutate()
In the following example, we will calculate the birth rate
````r
countries%>%
  mutate(
    przyr.natur = birth.rate-death.rate
  )%>%
  head()
````
### Function case_when()
The ````case_when()```` function allows you to consider multiple cases (something like a multiple if).
````r
countries%>%
  mutate(
    przyr.natur = birth.rate-death.rate
  )%>%
  mutate(
    status=case_when(
     przyr.natur> 0.0 ~ "rozwój",
     przyr.natur==0.0 ~ "stagnacja",
     przyr.natur< 0.0 ~ "wymieranie"
    )
  )%>%
  head(n=18)
````
### Function transmute()
The ````transmute()```` function is very similar on ````mutate()```` and is used to creat new columns. The main difference is that ````transmute()```` returns only the newly created columns, while ````mutate()```` keeps the original columns and adds new ones.
````r
countries%>%
  transmute(
    country, # ta stara zmienna zostaje
    przyr.natur = birth.rate-death.rate # ta nowa zmienna jest właśnie utworzona
  )%>%
  head()
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5eb5611-a422-4c38-a017-fc76c2aac5ad)
### Function rename()
The ````rename()```` function is used to rename columns.
````r
countries%>%
  transmute(
    country, # ta stara zmienna zostaje
    przyr.natur = birth.rate-death.rate 
  )%>%
  rename(kraj=country)%>%
  head()
````

#### 2
- In the iris frame, the variables Petal.Length and Petal.Width are the length and width of the petal, respectively. Assuming that the petal is approximately an ellipse, calculate its area (length and width are the axes of the ellipse). Add the result as a new variable to the frame, and then sort it against the new variable.
````r
iris %>%
  mutate(
    pole_platka  = pi * (Petal.Length / 2) * (Petal.Width / 2)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pole_platka)) %>% 
  head()
````

#### 3
- Add another column to the above box, which classifies “verbally” the petals as “small”, “medium” or “large” based on the area of the petal. For classification, you can use, for example, quartiles (small petals below the first quartile, medium - between the first and third, large - above the third, quartiles must be calculated, for example, summary).
````r
  iris %>%
  mutate(
    pole_platka  = pi * (Petal.Length / 2) * (Petal.Width / 2)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pole_platka)) %>% 
    mutate(
      wielkosc = case_when(
        pole_platka < 0.32987 ~ "male",
        pole_platka >=0.32987 & pole_platka <=7.61051 ~ "srednie",
        pole_platka > 7.61051 ~ "duze")) %>% 
head()
