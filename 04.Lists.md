````r
li$num
li[[1]]

li$num - if you write a list name, than $ symbol, then name of element. You can see the element of the list <br>
li[[1]] - if you write a list name then double [[]]  You can see the element of the list

attributes() - function is used to get all the attributes of list <br>
str() - function shows you what is in the object in a simple and concise way. It allows you to quickly see what data is in the object, its type and size <br>
