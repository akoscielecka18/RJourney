### IF
- Conditional statements <br>
Using these statements different blocks of code can be executed depending on whether a condition is true or false.
````r
if (condition) {
  # Code to be executed if condition is true
}

if (condition) {
  # Code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  # Code to be executed if condition is false
}

#example
a = 200
b = 33
if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater then a")
} else if (a == b) {
  print("a and b are equal")
} else {
  print("a is greater then b")
}
````
### FOR
- A FOR loop is used for iterating over a sequence.
````r
x= numeric(10)  # x = NULL
for (i in 1:10) {
  x[i] = i
}
x
````
At first we have to initialize the variable x, we can do that in both ways <br>
numeric(10) - creates a vector of length 10 filled with zeros <br>
NULL - assigning NULL tells that variable exists, even though it is empty <br>
Then we initialize the loop ````(i in 1:10) ```` it means take every element from 1:10 and sign it to i in order, in ```` { } ```` we write a block of instructions to be executed.

### WHILE
- A WHILE loop is used when the number of repetitions of the loop is not fixed.
````r
x=NULL 
i=0 
while(i<10) 
  { 
    i=i+1 
    x[i]=i 
  } 
x
````
At first the same as in for loop, we initialize the variable x, then initialize the variable i (it is important!). In the parentheses we create a stop condition (in this case the loop will continue to execute as long as i <10). Then in ```` { } ```` we write a block of instructions to be executed.

### REPEAT
- A REPEAT loop runs a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is true.
````r
x=NULL
i=1
repeat{
  x[i]=i
  if (i>=10){
    break 
  } 
  i=i+1 
}
x
````
At first the same as always :) , we initialize the variable x, then initialize the variable i. In the ```` { } ```` we create a block of instructions to be executed. But in the middle when the ```` if() ```` condition is true, we use ```` break ```` to stop our loop. <br>

For every loop above the answer is ```` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ````.
#### 1
- Generate a 50-element sample x=(x1,...,x50) from a uniform distribution on the interval [0,1] using the runif() function <br>
Create a vector y=(y1,...,y50), such that yi=0, when xi<0.5 generated in subsection a. and yi=1. Otherwise, using the if statement and, successively, the for, while and repe loops.
````r
x = runif(50, min=0, max=1)
y=numeric(50)
for(i in 1:50)
{
  if(x[i]<0.5){
    y[1]=0
  }else{
    y[i]=1
  }
}
print(y)
i=0
y1=numeric(50)
while(i<50)
{
  i=i+1
  if(x[i]<0.5){
    y1[1]=0
  }else{
    y1[i]=1
  }
}
print(y1)
i=1
y2=numeric(50)
repeat
{
  if(x[i]<0.5){
    y2[1]=0
  }else{
    y2[i]=1
  }
  if(i>=50){
    break
  }
  i=i+1
}
print(y2)
````
runif(n, min=0, max=1) - generates random deviates
#### 2
- Using nested for loops, compute the first N rows of Pascal's triangle using the recursive formula (n+1k)=(nk-1)+(nk) For k=1,...,n. We store the results in a square matrix of size N.
````r
N= 10
N = N*N
w= rep(0, times =N)
N = sqrt(N)
A = matrix(w, nrow = N, ncol=N)

A[1,1] =1
A[2,1] = 1
A[2,2] =1

for(i in 3:N){
  for(j in 1:i){
    if((j-1) == 0){
      A[i,j] = A[i-1,j]
    } else{
      A[i,j] = A[i-1, j-1] + A[i-1,j]
    }
  }
}
A
````
#### 3
- Write code that determines whether a string is a palindrome
````r
s= "radar"
substr(s,1,1)
n = nchar(s)
ceiling(n/2)
i=1
k=0
  while(i <= ceiling((n+1)/2)){
    if(substr(s,i,i)!=substr(s,n+1-i,n+1-i)){
      print(paste(s, "is not palindrome"))
      k=1
      break
    }
    i=i+1
}
if(k==0){
  print(paste(s,"is palindrome"))
}
````
