### IF
- Conditional statements <br>
Using these statements different blocks of code can be executed depending on whether a condition is true or false.
````r
if (condition) {
  # Code to be executed if condition is true
}

if (condition) {
  # Code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  # Code to be executed if condition is false
}

#example
a = 200
b = 33
if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater then a")
} else if (a == b) {
  print("a and b are equal")
} else {
  print("a is greater then b")
}
````
### FOR
- A FOR loop is used for iterating over a sequence
````r
x= numeric(10)  # x = NULL
for (i in 1:10) {
  x[i] = i
}
x
````
At first we have to initialize the variable x, we can do that in both ways <br>
numeric(10) - creates a vector of length 10 filled with zeros <br>
NULL - assigning NULL tells that variable exists, even though it is empty <br>
Then we initialize the loop ````(i in 1:10) ```` it means take every element from 1:10 and sign it to i in order, in ```` { } ```` we write a block of instructions to be executed 

### WHILE
- A WHILE loop
