### ggplot 
It is a statistical graphics package. Unfortunately, it is not automatically loaded or installed, you have to install it, and then when you want to use it you have to call the command ```` library(ggplot2) ````. <br>
By default, in order to create a chart, 
you must first load the data into it we do this using a data frame through the ```` data ```` parameter and passing the ```` aes ```` function, 
specifying what data from the ````data````will be mapped onto the chart and how. 
````r
library(ggplot2) 
wart_x=seq(0,10, by=0.1)
wart_y=sin(wart_x)
wart_z=cos(wart_x)
df = data.frame(kol_x=wart_x,kol_sin=wart_y,kol_cos=wart_z) 
ggplot(data=df, aes(x = kol_x, y = kol_sin)) + geom_line()
````

```` geom_line() ```` command responsible for drawing a graph
### Many Charts
We can apply multiple layers to a single drawing by adding more geometry with the + operator.
````r
ggplot(df, aes(x=kol_x,y=kol_sin))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_line(aes(x=kol_x,y=kol_cos))
````
