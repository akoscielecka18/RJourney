Initialize two vectors: a=[4,0.5, 7, 0.5] and b=[2,0.1,3, 5.2].
````r
a = c(4,0.5,7,0.5)
b = c(2,0.1,3, 5.2)
sum(a)/length(a) #Count the average for vector a
sum(a*b) #Count the scalar product of aâˆ˜b
sum(a*b)/sum(b) #Count the weighted average, of the elements of vector a, where the weights are defined in vector b
sqrt(sum((a-b)^2)) #Calculate the Euclidean distance between vectors a and b
