- Initialize two vectors: a=[4,0.5, 7, 0.5] and b=[2,0.1,3, 5.2].
````r
a = c(4,0.5,7,0.5)
b = c(2,0.1,3, 5.2)
sum(a)/length(a) #Count the average for vector a
sum(a*b) #Count the scalar product of a∘b
sum(a*b)/sum(b) #Count the weighted average, of the elements of vector a, where the weights are defined in vector b
sqrt(sum((a-b)^2)) #Calculate the Euclidean distance between vectors a and b
````
####
- Operations on vectors
````r
a[1]
a[1:5]=1
````
In the first operation [ ] is used to access the coordinates of the vector, while in the second operation we perform the assignment of the first five coordinates of the vector a value of 1

mean() - taking the sum of the values and dividing with the number of values <br>
rep() - replicate elements of vectors or lists a certain number of times. <br>
seq(from, to, by) - generate the general or regular sequences from the given inputs <br>
sort() - sort a vector into ascending or descending order <br>
order() - function is used to return items that indicate the sort order of the elements of a vector. It does not sort the vector itself, but returns indexes with which to sort the data
#### 2
- Let x=(7,9,13,8,4,2,16,1,6,19,15,12,19,14,8,2,19,11,18,7). For each of the following subsections, construct an object yi,i=1,...,4 containing:
````r

y_2 = x[1:5] # The first five elements of vector x
y_3 = which(x>14) #The indexes and coordinates of vector x, for which xi>14
y_4 = x[-c(6,10,12)] # All elements except the elements at positions 6, 10 and 12

#### 3 
- Using only the rep() and seq() functions, generate the following strings

#### 5
- Generate a 50-element sample x=(x1,...,x50) from a uniform distribution on the interval [0,1]using the runif() function. Create a vector y=(y1,...,y50), such that yi=0, when xi<0.5 and yi=1 in the opposite case.
````r

y = rep(1, 50)
y[x <0.5]=0

runif() - generate random values from a uniform distribution in R.
