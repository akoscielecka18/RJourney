### BASIC GRAPHICS 
The basic method of creating graphs in R is to use the ```` plot(x,y) ```` command , where x is the argument vector (OX axis) and y is the value vector (OY axis).
#### Example 
````r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y)
````

With the ```` x ```` variable, we defined the argument interval of our function, then with ```` y ```` we wrote how we wanted the graph of the function to look like. Finally, using the ```` plot(x,y) ```` command, we gave the values of our function's arguments as the x argument, and the corresponding values of the function defined with the y variable as the y.

#### Types of lines
````r
plot(x,y, type = 'l')
plot(x,y, type = 'b')
plot(x,y, type = 'h')
plot(x,y, type = 's')
````

```` type = 'l' ```` line connecting the points <br>
```` type = 'b' ```` points and line at the same time. Other combinations of lines with points: ```` type = 'c' type = 'o' ```` <br>
```` type = 'h' ```` vertical lines from the X axis to the points (bar-style histogram) <br>
```` type = 's' ```` staircase graph
#### Colors of lines 
```` r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y,type='l',col='red')
````

```` col ```` command allows us to give a color to our chart. <br>

#### Axis and Graph names
````r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y, type='l',col='red',xlab='arg x',ylab='x^2',main='Graph title')
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f46c17b-32d2-485e-90a0-66d93922f8fe)

```` xlab ```` x-axis name <br>
```` ylab ```` y-axis name <br>
```` main ```` graph title
#### Adding points to a graph
````r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y, type='l',col='red',xlab='arg x',ylab='x^2',main='Graph title')
x2=seq(1,10,by=.5)
y2=exp(x2)
points(x2,y2,col='blue',pch='k')
````

First, we create the arguments and values of our points ( ```` x2 y2 ````). <br>
```` points(x2,y2,col= ,pch= ) ```` points command allows us to add points to the chart <br>
```` pch = ```` pch command allows us to set the symbol of the points marked on the chart 

#### Adding lines to a graph
````r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y, type='l',col='red',xlab='arg x',ylab='x^2',main='Graph title')
y2=exp(x)
lines(x,y2,col='gray')
````

We proceed very similarly to the previous example, in which we added points. <br>
```` lines(x,y2,col=) ```` lines command allows us to add line to the chart

#### Dividing the window into parts
````r
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) 
plot(x,sin(x),type='l')
plot(x,cos(x),type='l')
````

```` par(mfrow=c(1,2))  ```` par command allows us to divide the window into 1 * 2 smaller window
