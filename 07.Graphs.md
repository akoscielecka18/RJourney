### BASIC GRAPHICS 
The basic method of creating graphs in R is to use the ```` plot(x,y) ```` command , where x is the argument vector (OX axis) and y is the value vector (OY axis).
#### Example 
````r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y)
````

With the ```` x ```` variable, we defined the argument interval of our function, then with ```` y ```` we wrote how we wanted the graph of the function to look like. Finally, using the ```` plot(x,y) ```` command, we gave the values of our function's arguments as the x argument, and the corresponding values of the function defined with the y variable as the y.

#### Types of lines
````r
plot(x,y, type = 'l')
plot(x,y, type = 'b')
plot(x,y, type = 'h')
plot(x,y, type = 's')
````

```` type = 'l' ```` line connecting the points <br>
```` type = 'b' ```` points and line at the same time. Other combinations of lines with points: ```` type = 'c' type = 'o' ```` <br>
```` type = 'h' ```` vertical lines from the X axis to the points (bar-style histogram) <br>
```` type = 's' ```` staircase graph
#### Colors of lines 
```` r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y,type='l',col='red')
````

```` col ```` command allows us to give a color to our chart. <br>

#### Axis and Graph names
````r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y, type='l',col='red',xlab='arg x',ylab='x^2',main='Graph title')
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f46c17b-32d2-485e-90a0-66d93922f8fe)

```` xlab ```` x-axis name <br>
```` ylab ```` y-axis name <br>
```` main ```` graph title
#### Adding points to a graph
````r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y, type='l',col='red',xlab='arg x',ylab='x^2',main='Graph title')
x2=seq(1,10,by=.5)
y2=exp(x2)
points(x2,y2,col='blue',pch='k')
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aa244f4-1f63-4176-984e-acdd01c8fc54)

First, we create the arguments and values of our points ( ```` x2 y2 ````). <br>
```` points(x2,y2,col= ,pch= ) ```` points command allows us to add points to the chart <br>
```` pch = ```` pch command allows us to set the symbol of the points marked on the chart 

#### Adding lines to a graph
````r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y, type='l',col='red',xlab='arg x',ylab='x^2',main='Graph title')
y2=exp(x)
lines(x,y2,col='gray')
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccad2d3d-f994-4e8f-906f-f9856317b141)

We proceed very similarly to the previous example, in which we added points. <br>
```` lines(x,y2,col=) ```` lines command allows us to add line to the chart

#### Dividing the window into parts
````r
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) 
plot(x,sin(x),type='l')
plot(x,cos(x),type='l')
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0f5b3ef-2c51-4ccb-9b7f-cff8616f3371)

```` par(mfrow=c(1,2))  ```` par command allows us to divide the window into 1 * 2 smaller window

#### 1 
- a. Draw the graph of the function sin on the interval [0,10] <br>
b.  Draw again the graph of the function sin, adding this time the range of the OY axis [-1.5,1.5]. (ylim option). Give the graph a title, e.g. “Graph of the sin function”, name the OX axis “Angle”, and name the OY axis “sinus”. <br>
c. Add a line with equation y=x2π to the previous graph using the lines function. Use the color red, for example. <br>
d. Add points to the previous graph with coordinates (0,1.3), (1,1), and (2,1) using the points function - draw the points with a blue '*' symbol.
````r
x=seq(0,10,by=0.01)
plot(x,sin(x),type='l')
plot(x, sin(x), type = "l", ylim = c(-1.5, 1.5), 
     main = "Graph of the sin function", xlab = "Angle", ylab = "sinus")
y2=x/(2*pi)
lines(x,y2,col='red')
points(c(0, 1, 2), c(1.3, 1, 1), col='blue', pch = "*")
````

#### 2
- Divide the graphics window into 2*2 parts and draw <br>
graph of the function cos in the upper left corner <br>
graph of the function sin in the upper right corner <br>
graph of function exp in the bottom left corner <br>
graph of the log function in the bottom right corner
````r
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) 
plot(x,cos(x),type='l', 
     main = "graph of the function cos", xlab = "x1", ylab = "cos(x1)")
plot(x,sin(x),type='l', 
     main = "graph of the function sin", xlab = "x2", ylab = "sin(x2)")
plot(x,exp(x),type='l', 
     main = "graph of function exp", xlab = "x3", ylab = "exp(x3)")
plot(x,log(x),type='l', 
     main = "graph of the log function", xlab = "x4", ylab = "log(x4)")
````

#### 3
- Create a data frame with 2 columns: the height of the anemometer (the data above) and the daily average (the average of the Avg columns - you need to count) - 5 rows, because we have 5 devices. Draw a graph of the dependence of the average wind speed on the altitude (the so-called vertical profile of the wind) - a command like plot(altitude, average) should suffice. Add descriptions of the axes, the title of the graph.

````r
ane_w1 = read.csv("C:\\Users\\akosc\\OneDrive\\Pulpit\\Ania\\studia\\r\\dane_w1.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
wysokosc_anemometru=c(140,140,137,112,84)
urzadzenie=c('Anemometr1','Anemometr2','Anemometr3','Anemometr4')
predkosc=c(mean(dane_w1$Anemometer.1.wind_speed.Avg),
           mean(dane_w1$Anemometer.2.wind_speed.Avg),mean(dane_w1$Ultrasonic.wind_speed.Avg),
           mean(dane_w1$Anemometer.3.wind_speed.Avg),
           mean(dane_w1$Anemometer.4.wind_speed.Avg))
ramka=data.frame(wysokosc_anemometru,predkosc)
plot(wysokosc_anemometru,predkosc,  main = "Profil pionowy wiatru", xlab = "Wysokość [m]", ylab = "Prędkość wiatru [m/s]", pch='*', col = 'green')
