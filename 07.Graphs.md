### BASIC GRAPHICS 
The basic method of creating graphs in R is to use the ```` plot(x,y) ```` command , where x is the argument vector (OX axis) and y is the value vector (OY axis).
#### Example 
````r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y)
````

With the ```` x ```` variable, we defined the argument interval of our function, then with ```` y ```` we wrote how we wanted the graph of the function to look like. Finally, using the ```` plot(x,y) ```` command, we gave the values of our function's arguments as the x argument, and the corresponding values of the function defined with the y variable as the y.

#### Types of lines
````r
plot(x,y, type = 'l')
plot(x,y, type = 'b')
plot(x,y, type = 'h')
plot(x,y, type = 's')
````

```` type = 'l' ```` line connecting the points <br>
```` type = 'b' ```` points and line at the same time. Other combinations of lines with points: ```` type = 'c' type = 'o' ```` <br>
```` type = 'h' ```` vertical lines from the X axis to the points (bar-style histogram) <br>
```` type = 's' ```` staircase graph
#### Colors of lines 
```` r
x=1:10
y=x*x
plot(x,y,type='l',col='red')
````

```` col ```` command allows us to give a color to our chart. <br>
